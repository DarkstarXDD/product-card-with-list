### Notes. üìå

- I initially did the project with vanilla CSS using CSS modules. But after completing the project i redid all the styles in Tailwind. The solution with vanilla CSS is in a separate branch called [css-modules](https://github.com/DarkstarXDD/product-list-with-cart/tree/css-modules).

### Testing and Accessibility. üß™

- Tested site usability with keyboard-only navigation.
- Used the Responsively App to check the site's appearance on various screen sizes, from 320x480 to 3000x2000.
- Set the browser font size on desktop to various values ranging from 9px to 72px to make sure everything on the site scales properly with the user's preferred browser font size.

- Tested with the NVDA screen reader.
- Viewed the site on an iPhone 11 in both portrait and landscape modes.
